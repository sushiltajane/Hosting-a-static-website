# My Static Web

This repository hosts a static website built using a template from Creative Tim. The goal is to deploy the website using GitHub Pages.

## Steps Followed

### 1. Create a Folder
We created a folder to hold the project files.

### 2. Clone the Template
We cloned a static website template from **Creative Tim** to use as the base design for our website. To do this, we used the following command:

``

git clone https://github.com/shreyashpatil4266/my-static-web

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with template files"
git push -u origin main


git checkout main
git push origin --delete master


* Set Up GitHub Pages
To host the site on GitHub Pages:

Go to your repository on GitHub.

Navigate to Settings > Pages.

Under Source, select the main branch and /root folder for deployment.

Your website will now be live on GitHub Pages!
